# TodoAppsss
In this repository you can find diffrent versions of a simple ToDo webapp. With diffrent versions I mean same app written in diffrent frameworks/languages. The main languages/frameworks i want to focus on for now are:

*   Vanille Javacript
    * Functional Way
    * Object Oriented Way
*   React
    * Normal React
    * Redux
*   Vue
    * Normal Vue
    * Vuex
*   Php
    * Normal Php
    * Object oriented Php
    * Php Laravel (not guarenteed)

Of course are there more options to write a web app within a certain framework or language.
